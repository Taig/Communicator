# Communicator

> An [OkHttp][1] wrapper for Scala built with Android in mind

Communicator provides a simple `scala.concurrent.Future` implementation that handles your requests based on plain
OkHttp request and client objects. Additional callbacks (e.g. to track upload and download progress) simplify your
codebase tremendously.

Communicator was built for Android, but has no dependencies to the framework and works fine with any Scala project.

**Feature Highlights**

- Request class implements `scala.concurrent.Future`
- Easy progress updates with `onSend()` and `onReceive()` callbacks
- Progress updates support OkHttp's "transparent GZIP"
- Lovely Android integration due to callback `ExecutionContext` parameter

## Installation

`libraryDependencies += "io.taig" %% "communicator" % "2.0.1"`

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
````scala
// Get all important classes and conversions in scope
import io.taig.communicator._

// Provide implicit executors, just as using scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

// Make sure an OkHttpClient is in implicit scope
implicit val client = new OkHttpClient()
````

**Create and execute**
````scala
// Single thread executor to handle progress updates
val single = ExecutionContext.fromExecutor( Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor() )

Request( "http://www.scala-lang.org/" )    // Prepare metadata (okhttp.Request.Builder)
	.parse[String]()                       // Start request in parse mode
	.onReceive( println )( single )        // Execute callback on single ExecutionContext
	.onSuccess( response =>
	{
		println( s"${response.code} ${response.message}" )
		println( s"${response.payload.take( 30 )}...${response.payload.takeRight( 30 )}" )
	} )
````

## Usage

### Prerequisites

As already shown in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section, you'll need to import the *Communicator* API via:

````scala
import io.taig.communicator._
````

Furthermore Scala Futures require an implicit `ExecutionContext` in scope, the suggested default is:

````scala
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
````

Each request requires an `OkHttpClient` instance to be passed along. The recommended way is to provide it as an
implicit, but there are also factory methods available that allow to specify the client explicitly.

> **Please Note**  
This section is very important for Android users. To learn how to work with the default Android thread pool and the UI
thread, please read the [Android](#android) section.

### Metadata

Each *Communicator* request is based on an `okhttp.Request` that you need to prepare in advance. This library provides
helpers to simplify the construction. All of the below yield the same result and should give you a feeling of the
available implicit conversions!

````scala
import com.squareup.okhttp

new okhttp.Request.Builder()
	.url( "http://www.scala-lang.org/" )
	.build()
````

````scala
Request()
	.url( "http://www.scala-lang.org/" )
 	.build()
````

````scala
Request( "http://www.scala-lang.org/" ).build()
````

### Request: Plain, Parse and Handle

There are three different request types, depending on your use case.

#### `Request.Plain`

This is the simplest type. A plain request does not gather any information about the response body. This may be useful
for API write requests where you only care about the response code or an HTTP Head request.

````scala
Request.plain( request )
````

#### `Request.Parser[T]`

Processes the response body to yield an object of type `T`. You need to bring an implicit parser in scope. By default
*Communicator* is equipped with a `String` parser.

To create a custom parser you have to implement `io.taig.communicator.Parser`:

````scala
trait Parser[T]
{
	def parse( response: Response, stream: InputStream ): T
}
````

A sample implementation that parses the response body to JSON:

````scala
import play.api.libs.json.Json

object Json extends Parser[JsValue]
{
	def parse( response: Response, stream: InputStream ): JsValue =
	{
		Json.parse( stream )
	}
}
````

````scala
implicit def parser = Json

Request.parse[JsValue]( request )	// Implicit parser
Request.parse( request, Json )		// Explicit parser
````

#### `Request.Handler`

Is very similar to `Request.Parser[T]`, in fact you can think of it as a special case for `Request.Parser[Unit]`.
Handler is for response body processing where you don't care about the result (e.g. forward data to some log file). You
need to bring an implicit handler in scope.

To create a custom handler you have to implement `io.taig.communicator.Handler`:

````scala
trait Handler
{
	def handle( response: Response, stream: InputStream ): Unit
}
````

````scala
implicit def handler = MyLogFileHandler

Request.handle( request )                    // Implicit parser
Request.handle( request, MyLogFileHandler )  // Explicit parser
````

#### Shortcut

When creating an `okhttp.Request` in preparation you can take an implicit shortcut to the `communicator.Request`:

````scala
Request( "http://www.scala-lang.org/" ).get().build().parse[String]()
Request( "http://www.scala-lang.org/" ).get().parse[String]()
````

### Event Callbacks

Since the *Communicator* `Request` inherits from `scala.concurrent.Future`, you can rely on the default callbacks like
`onComplete()` or `onSuccess()`. Furthermore *Communicator* allows you to chain event callbacks to keep your code clean.
But please keep in mind that this does not necessarily insure a corresponding execution order.

> The `onComplete`, `onSuccess`, and `onFailure` methods have result type `Unit`, which means invocations of these
methods cannot be chained. Note that this design is intentional, to avoid suggesting that chained invocations may imply
an ordering on the execution of the registered callbacks (callbacks registered on the same future are unordered).  
â€” http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html

The most prominent addition to the Future API are the progress tracking callbacks `onSend()` and `onReceive()` to
handle upload and download progress.

> **Please Note**  
Bear in mind that the `onSend()` callback requires you to specify an explicit content length in your request body and
that `onReceive()` is only aware of the total response size if the server includes this information in its response
headers!

### Response

Similar to the request types `Request.Plain`, `Request.Handler` and `Request.Parser`, there are corresponding response
types `Response.Plain`, `Response.Handled` and `Response.Parsed[T]`. They basically wrap the `okhttp.Response` and
provide the same information except for the body which is only available in a `Response.Parsed[T]` as `payload`.

## Android

Using *Communicator* on Android does not differ from the explanations in the [Usage](#usage) section. But you can make
your life a lot easier with a properly defined `ExecutionContext`.

````scala
package com.example.app

import android.os.{AsyncTask, Handler, Looper}
import java.util.concurrent.Executor
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext

package object app
{
	val Executor = new
	{
		// ExecutionContext for asynchronous processing, relying on Android's idea of threading
		implicit lazy val Pool = ExecutionContext.fromExecutor( AsyncTask.THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR )

		// UI thread executor
		lazy val Ui = ExecutionContext.fromExecutor( new Executor
		{
			private val handler = new Handler( Looper.getMainLooper )

			override def execute( command: Runnable ) = handler.post( command )
		} )
	}
}
````

With this definition around you can now go ahead, run asynchronous HTTP requests and update your UI without cluttering
your code.

````scala
import io.taig.communicator._
import com.example.app.Executor._

val dialog: android.app.ProgressDialog = ???

Request( "http://www.scala-lang.org/" )
	.parse[String]()
	.onReceive
	{
		case progress @ Progress.Receive( _, Some( _ ) ) =>
			dialog.setProgress( progress.percentage.get.toInt )
		case Progress.Receive( _, None ) => dialog.setIndeterminate( true )
	}( Ui )
	.onFinish( _ => dialog.dismiss() )( Ui )
	.onSuccess( response => showConfirmationDialog( response.payload ) )( Ui )
	.onFailure( exception => showErrorDialog( exception ) )( Ui )
````
