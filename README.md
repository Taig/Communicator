Communicator
============

A simple Java networking library for the Android platform. It's based on `HttpURLConnection` as [recommended] [1] by
Google. *Communicator* aims to provide maximum flexibility with minimal verbosity and helps to accomplish common use cases.

> **Please Note**  
> Communicator is currently in a very early development state. Therefore please excuse the lack of documentation and
> frequent API changes.
