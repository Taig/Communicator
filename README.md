Communicator
============

A simple Java networking library for the Android platform. It's based on `HttpURLConnection` as [recommended] [1] by
Google. *Communicator* aims to provide maximum flexibility with minimal verbosity and helps to accomplish common use cases.

> **Please Note**  
> Communicator is currently in a very early development state. Therefore please excuse the lack of documentation and
> frequent API changes.

Installation
------------

[Download] [2] the latest release as a `*.jar` file and add it to your Android app's `libs/` folder. Android will
take care of adding the dependency to your classpath. You're already good to go now. If you want more from life then
simplicity: [read] [3] this.
